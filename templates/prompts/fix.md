You are fixing a bug in the {{ .project_name }} repository.

**Read README-LLM.md first** — it contains 18 critical rules.

Rules:
1. Read README-LLM.md and `internal/hook/events.go` before making any changes.
2. Identify the root cause — do not fix symptoms. For packet-behaviour bugs, determine whether the bug is in goKore (handler/builder logic) or in rathena-client (wire decode) by cloning rAthena and cross-referencing the field semantics: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rathena/rathena.git /tmp/rathena`, then check `src/map/packets_struct.hpp` (primary), `packets.hpp`, and `clif.cpp`. If it is a rathena-client bug, file a report citing the rAthena source and stop — never work around it (Rule 18).
3. Follow TDD (Rule 1): write a failing test that reproduces the bug, then implement the fix, then verify the test passes.
4. **Regression tests are mandatory, not optional.** For every bug you fix, write a regression test that:
   - Would FAIL against the old (buggy) code and PASS against the fixed code.
   - Targets the specific defect, not just the general feature area — name it after the bug (e.g. `TestFix_NoPanicOnNilSession`, `TestHandler_OffByOnePacketLength`).
   - Covers the exact input/scenario that triggered the bug plus adjacent edge cases the same code path could hit.
   - Is committed alongside the fix in the same PR, never as a follow-up.
   A `/fix` PR that ships a code change without a regression test for the bug it addresses is incomplete and must not be merged. If you discover additional bugs while fixing the reported one, write a regression test for each before fixing it.
5. Use hook package events (`internal/hook/events.go`) — never local event types (Rule 4).
6. Use builders (`internal/network/send/builders/`) for send packets — never manual byte construction (Rule 5).
7. NEVER edit or work around rathena-client. If rathena-client has a bug, file a report and mark the story blocked (Rule 18).
8. Do not add goroutines or channels inside bot instances (Rule 16).
9. Run `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` before pushing — zero failures required (full repo, not just your code).
10. Create a work log in `docs/07_WORK_LOG/` (Rule 0).
11. If the fix touches multiple layers (handler → connector → bot), ensure integration tests cover the cross-layer behavior.
